### What is This Is A Demo?

This blog started as a way to play with the idea of moving my old blogs from sources like WordPress, Blogger, etc to something I could control myself.  Also something that was free. :) So this blog was born out of the need to learn how to use Hugo, GitHub Pages, and a front end like Front Matter. I have a way to go because everything is all new to me.  Markdown language is also a learning curve.

#### About GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to host your websites and your projects directly from a [Github repository](https://github.com/).

#### About Hugo

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and
configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website. With its
amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

Learn more on [GitHub](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). Complete documentation is available at
[Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).

#### About Front Matter

[Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/) is a free and open-source platform, dedicated to making it one of the best CMSs for your static site generator. I found them while trying to use other front ends for Jykell before I decided to use Hugo.
