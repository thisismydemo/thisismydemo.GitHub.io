The [The Festive Tech Calendar](https://festivetechcalendar.com/) is a free, month-long, fun tech event that takes place throughout December. The event features new content from different communities and people around the globe. The event is organized by [Cloud Family](https://cloudfamily.info/festivetechcalendar/) and is aimed at people from all communities who want to participate in a fun and engaging session that is a bit different from a normal conference. On the 6th of December I did a session called "The 12 Days of Azure Arc-Mas." The link to the video is below. If you are in the Dallas-Fort Worth area (Texas), I will be doing a [DFWSMUG](https://dfwsmug.org/) Edition of this session as well at the [Winter Meet up on December 14th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dfwsmug-winter-event-tickets-747662126547?aff=oddtdtcreator&utm-source=cp&utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discovery&utm-term=listing)!
