The Microsoft 425Show
=====================

I recently had the privilege to be on [The Microsoft 425Show](https://425show.simplecast.com/), a **Microsoft security chat show**.  The topic of the podcast was Entra Permissions Management: Partner Perspectives.  I had a great time talking with co-workers and with [Shannon Kuehn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannonkuehn) a Senior Product Manager in the Identity product group at Microsoft.

You can access the show podcast from this link [Entra Permissions Management: Partner Perspectives](https://425show.simplecast.com/episodes/entra-permissions-management-partner-perspectives) or stick around and listen below.

I look forward to more blogs about [Microsoft Entra and the family of multicloud identity and access products](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra).

Shameless plug warning.....
