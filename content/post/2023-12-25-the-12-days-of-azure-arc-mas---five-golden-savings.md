## Azure Hybrid Benefit: A Beacon of Cost Optimization

## Extended Security Updates: Shielding Legacy Systems

In the realm of legacy systems, Azure Arc acts as a vigilant guardian. It extends the life of older, unsupported versions of Windows Server and SQL Server such as the 2012/R2 editions. By providing Extended Security Updates, Azure Arc ensures these legacy systems remain secure and compliant, which is vital for industries bound by stringent regulatory frameworks. This protection also mitigates the financial risks associated with security violations or non-compliance penalties.

Moreover, Azure Arc aids in cost-effective transition planning. It offers organizations a pathway to migrate to newer versions while securing their existing infrastructure, thus avoiding immediate and extensive capital outlays.

**Azure Arc's Extended Security Updates** breathe new life into older, unsupported versions of Windows Server and SQL Server, such as the 2008/R2 editions, ensuring:

- **Continued security and compliance:** Maintain the integrity of legacy systems, crucial for strict regulatory adherence.
- **Minimized risk and compliance costs:** Protect against costly security breaches and non-compliance penalties.

Azure Arc's **unified management capabilities** offer:

- **Simplified multi-environment management:** A single pane of glass for diverse resources reduces complexity and cost.
