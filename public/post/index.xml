      <title>Dipping My Big Toe Into Cross-Tenant Synchronization Part I</title>

      <guid>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/dipping-big-toe-cross-tenant-synchronization-part/</guid>
      <description>So, I am very interested in What cross-tenant synchronization is and what it could do for me and maybe for customers? Since I have a number of tenants I thought it would be good to at least try this preview feature and blog about my experience.
Also, this blog originally started out as a single blog but as I started to write it it grew and grew and grew. I wanted to refocus myself and break it up into smaller parts.</description>

      <description>I guess this will be part II of another blog I wrote called What! My Azure Percept DK Devices Are Being Retired???. In that blog I mentioned how the Percept devices that were not cheap are now going into &amp;ldquo;retirement.&amp;rdquo; The only way to keep using them for other things is to install the last &amp;ldquo;Unsupported&amp;rdquo; firmware update before March 30th. This is my blog about how to install this update since you can no longer do OTA updates on existing devices at this time.</description>

      <description>Since I failed terribly at getting my old Azure Sphere Development kit up and running as documented in previous blogs I decided to move on to my Vision AI DevKit. This has been a trusty workhorse for me in the past assisting with many demos. However, just like my other devices, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used this in a while, now I need to reset it and set it up again.
The process The first thing I did was install the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).</description>

      <guid>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/is-my-azure-sphere-a-rock-now/</guid>
      <description>In a previous blog I wrote about having to recover my Azure Sphere Development Kit. So I decided to right one on what to do with it once I have recovered it. So this blog continues from My Azure Sphere Needs Reset?
However&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.
According to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s documentation on how to claim the device there is a call out:
Claiming a device is a one-time operation that you cannot undo even if the device is sold or transferred to another person or organization.</description>

      <title>What! My Azure Percept DK Devices Are Being Retired???</title>
      <link>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/what-my-azure-percept-dk-devices-are-being-retired/</link>

      <description>So recently I started working on another IoT project which lead me to breaking out all my old development kits. I previously wrote a blog called My Azure Sphere Needs Reset where I walked through recovering an old Azure Sphere Development Kit I had. So I decided to write another few blogs following how I had to do the same with all my devices since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really remember any of the configurations and some of these devices had been configured for long gone IoT Hubs and tenants that don&amp;rsquo;t exist anymore.</description>

      <title>My Azure Sphere Needs Reset?</title>
      <link>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/my-azure-sphere-needs-reset/</link>

      <guid>http://thisismydemo.cloud/post/my-azure-sphere-needs-reset/</guid>
      <description>So I needed to break out my Azure SPhere Development kit again that I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in a very long time. Since then, the tenant my Azure Sphere was registered to has changed, and along with other things like my memory in my aging head, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember for the life of me how to access the kit.
So this blog is mainly for me so in 6 months when I need to use my Azure Sphere development kit again I will have a quick and easy reminder.</description>

      <description>This is going to be one of those blogs that I write based off of things I didn&amp;rsquo;t know but learned in the heat of the moment.
I want to be able to have a normal user get on to the Entra Permissions Management portal to request the needed permissions they need. (This in itself is can be a blog and how to videos) So turned to Bing/Google/Chat GPT/My Dog&amp;hellip; nothing.</description>

      <description>Since I recently re-did a blog about how to install Windows Terminal I wanted to write a quick blog on some of my favorite customizations that I do for my Windows Terminal.
The three areas I always change are:
Open As Admin Always on Top Backgrounds for each profile. (ie, PowerShell, Azure Cloud, Ubuntu, etc). So how exciting is it to look at this all day?
Well, a few clicks here and a few clicks there can have your Windows Terminal looking a little more like yourself or at least a little like your own taste?</description>

      <description>I have been working with Intune Proactive Remediation scripts I wanted to share a few that I am working on.If you want to know more about Intune Proactive Remediation you can check on past blogs of mine.

      <description>I want to start this blog out by saying I am not an Intune expert. In fact I don&amp;rsquo;t really spend much time with Intune. However, once in a while there are projects that require certain tools like InTune so once in a while I do get my hands on Intune. So I want to share what I have learned about Intune Proactive Remediation and how to create and apply them in your Endpoint environment.</description>

      <description>Early this year I had written a blog talking about how to enable Windows Terminal on Windows Server. However, I deleted that blog and all content and can&amp;rsquo;t find my backups so I am re-writing it once again. I wanted to share my experience with installing Windows Terminal on Windows Server and what I had to do to get around the blockers I ran into. As I mentioned in the last blog I had ran into issues that other bloggers never seemed to run into when installing Windows Terminal.</description>

      <description>This post will be a walk through on how to quickly setup Entra Permissions Management for the first time. One of the best ways to try our Entra Permissions Management is to start a trial and just jump in. The Identity product group has a nice little user guide out there on Microsoft Learn Trial user guide: Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. There are also other ways to get your hands dirty with Entra, you can always reach out to my company and have us do an Entra PM multi-cloud risk assessment analyzes Azure and multi-cloud permissions risk.</description>

      <description>In order to map an Azure File share with Azure AD Kerberos authentication for hybrid user accounts enabled you need to make sure that you configure the clients to retrieve Kerberos tickets.
There are three methods that can accomplish this on your client computers.
Configure an Intune Policy and apply it to the clients. Configure Group Policy on the clients Apply a registry value on the client. I am going to use the registry method, but I will also be using Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Intune Proactive remediation.</description>
